Im pretty sure I've seen this one before
I've got a long drive, I'll tape my eyes
So I don't fall asleep again
Singing out
Up and down
They're nodding
Heads are moving up and down
You got it
Everybody stand in line
One by one, take a hit, join the club
Kids will try to take my vibes
Or am I on the outside?
I've got a long drive, I'll tape my eyes
So I don't fall asleep again
Singing out
Up and down
They're nodding
Heads are moving up and down
You got it
Everybody stand in line
One by one, take a hit, join the club
Kids will try to take my vibes
Or am I on the outside?
I am a Megalodon, oceans feeling like a pond
Swimming like a beast, underneath they be clinging on
Meteoric rise, in prehistoric times
Now that meteor is coming, coming
I am Megatron, cogs I'm stepping on
Then the little cogs got together, start a renaissance
Switched it up on me, fuel efficiency
On fumes I am running, running, running
Up and down
They're nodding
Heads are moving up and down
You got it
Everybody
Up and down
They're nodding
Heads are moving up and down
You got it
Everybody stand in line
One by one, take a hit, join the club
Kids will try to take my vibes
Or am I on the outside?
I'm on the outside in the summer heat
You can pay the cover charge, I'm in the street
Little do they know that they can't touch me
I'm vibin', vibin'
I'm on the outside in the summer heat
You can pay the cover charge, I'm in the street
Little do they know that they can't touch me
I'm vibin', vibin', yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah`;
